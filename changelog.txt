0.1.1
	fixed release variable not being initialized (thus crashing)
0.1.2
	upped the health of the remains so that they are less likely to be destroyed before you reach them. at least I think that's what made them dissapear :)
	Added Locales
    	fixed a bug where I forgot to check if game.player.character existed before indexing it
